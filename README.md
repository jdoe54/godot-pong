# godot-pong

Created on September 18 and used in a workshop for the UA Video Game Development Club workshop on September 25.
The project used GDScript, which is a variant of Python. 
The club members would follow along as I created the game while they tried to replicate it on their own laptops during the meeting in one hour.
